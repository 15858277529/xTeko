# What's this?

Is this a game based on SpriteKit?

Yes and No, JSBox doesn't support SpriteKit yet, but we can use it in a hacky way: [Runtime](https://docs.xteko.com/#/en/runtime/intro).

Runtime system provided by JSBox is very powerful, we can do many things even JSBox doesn't support.

In this project, we want to show you how to:

- Load frameworks dynamically
- Create/inherit native classes dynamically
- Call functions dynamically (reflection)
- Override existing functions dynamically (hook)

Yes, everything in this project is dynamic, it works like magic, you shouldn't always use Runtime unless you have to do it.

It helps you understand Runtime better, have fun!
